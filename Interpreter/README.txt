Assembly Interpreter
CS301 Midsemester project
Jason Warta

This assembly interpreter loads an 64-bit assembly binary into memory and executes it.

You are promted to provide integer input if you wish.

The interpreter can not execute files that make use of pointers or external function calls.

A factorial program source and binary are provided for demo purposes.

The additional libraries are necessary for execution on non-linux platforms, please leave them in their current location in the file hierarchy.
